CARROM GAME Assignment Submission

PROCESS EXPLANATION:

In this game I've made a carrom board and gave it 4 edge colliders and gave circle colliders to all pucks and striker.

There is a slider also to shift striker's position to a desired place. While moving the slider I've made sure that striker doesn't collide with other pucks, making them change their original position.

After Sliding the slider player can drag striker to charge the force of the shot and decide the direction.

There are timers for players, if they don't make a move within 10 sec their turn will be over and will move to next player.

As soon as striker moves the timer of player will be paused and until all the objects don't stop their movement, next turn won't start.

If Player potted their puck (Player1 = black pucks, AI = white pucks) or queen, they will get another chance. If player potted opponent's puck their turn will be over and that puck will be added to opponent's total.

In AI's Turn AI player will first choose a random place on the striker line, and from that position it will choose a random white puck on the board and will take a shot towards that puck.

If any player puts all their pucks in pocket, then the game will stop and winner will be declared. 

If the timer runs out the game will be over and the banner will be shown.

Player will be given restart button at the end of the game.
